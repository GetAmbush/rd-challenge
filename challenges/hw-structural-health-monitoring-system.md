# Structural Health Monitoring System

## Important Notes

- Please send us a report containing an overview of your system as well as
the reasoning behind your technical choices. Feel free to add any schematics 
and simulations that could add value to your answer. 

## Introduction

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the process of evaluating the 
health of a structure by reading an array of sensors attached to it. 
SHM systems are, usually, installed permanently into the structure 
for periodical evaluation of the construction. Through appropriate
data processing and interpretation of the dynamic response measurements,
it is possible to assess the current state of structural health 
and even predict the remaining life of the structure in the long run. 

## Description

You work in a construction company which is currently projecting a
footbridge. The structure is supposed to be evaluated periodically
for SHM. Engineers expect the structure to have a vibration 
frequency range from 2 to 50 Hz when excited. They have also 
estimated that structure vibration levels generated by
pedestrians or any other natural phenomena are up to 60 m/s². Also, 
your colleagues have estimated that for a reliable data analysis, the 
data needs to be recorded with a minimum resolution of 25 mm/s². Given 
this specification, your task is to design the system to record the 
data for further analysis.
