# Handwritten Character Recognition

## Important Notes

* Please organize, design, test and document your solution as if it were
going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository
(e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket...).

## Description

Your company is developing a software to digitize handwritten text. Your
team has already developed code to extract the image of each one of the
characters in a given text. You are given the task of developing a
machine learning model capable of reliably translating those images into
digital characters. After some research, you find the [EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset),
which seems perfect for the task.
